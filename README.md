# -SoC-Verification-Using-SystemVerilog-
This project demonstrates the functional verification of a simplified System-on-Chip (SoC) design using **SystemVerilog**. The SoC includes an embedded processor and peripheral components, verified through simulation using **testbenches**, **assertions**, and **constrained-random verification** techniques.
